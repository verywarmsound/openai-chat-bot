everything have terms personal property stake partnerships partnership relationship between two people carrying business together view making profit partnerships neither incorporated nor registered unlike company therefore partnership no separate legal identity purposes legal transaction litigation only members partnership employ people own property enter into contracts sued sole traders each partner regarded liable personal basis however different partnership each partner liable debts partnership assets seized pay off debts incurred partnership irrespective partner incurred debt words partnership unlimited liability partners regarded both jointly severally liable debts partnership management partnership normally shared among partners common practice have deed partnership prepared specifies agreements between partners no such deed prepared event dispute partnership act 1890 governs arrangement between partners profits income less expenditure normally divided equally between partners unless partnership deed specifies otherwise each partner individually responsible account inland revenue contributions agency earnings probably greatest single advantage partnership combination lack formal regulation coupled fact alone making decisions running business having several people particular strengths working well together produce very potent combination however sole trader things go wrong everything terms wealth stake limited liability companies company legal body own right incorporated under companies act 1985 amended 1989 most yacht brokerage companies normally
