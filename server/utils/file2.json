Such an individual may"},{"text":"be an enthusiastic amateur who dreams of building his own yacht from scratch or it may be the senior designer in the"},{"text":"design office of a design house or a production yacht builder."},{"text":"It is the designer’s role to come up with the initial concept of what the yacht is going to look like and what it is going to"},{"text":"achieve. Clearly the design requirements can vary enormously from that of a round the world ocean racing yacht to a"},{"text":"small robust harbour workboat."},{"text":"When considering design it is not just the exterior “styling” that is considered i.e. what it looks like when on the water, but"},{"text":"also the space utilisation and ergonomics of both the internal and external spaces."},{"text":"Depending upon the particular designer, his role may be to develop the concept that is then passed to a Naval Architect"},{"text":"to translate to a set of functional plans or it may be to develop the entire concept from idea to reality.

They define the structure of the yacht in terms of its physical strength, its"},{"text":"performance in terms of speed and power and its degree of stability i.e. just how well it will stay upright. The work will"},{"text":"generally involve input from others such as the Rules of a Classification Society, national (such as the British Standards"},{"text":"Institute) or indeed international (the International Organisation for Standardisation) minimum requirements. In some"},{"text":"cases (normally small craft used for commercial purposes) there are statutory regulations to comply with whilst for leisure"},{"text":"only craft there are statutory European Regulations that relate to the standards for a vessel sold within the European Union."},{"text":"The end result of the Naval Architect’s work is generally a set of detailed drawings which show all the parts of the yacht,"},{"text":"both structure and systems, together with a technical specification which details the functional and/or performance"},{"text":"requirements of every part of the yacht.

The builder will take the plans and starting from nothing will physically produce the"},{"text":"yacht from a range of different materials and sub systems."},{"text":"The actual building process will vary depending upon the type of material from which the yacht is to be built. However,"},{"text":"generally the builder will produce the hull, install major equipment inside, fit the deck and superstructure and then outfit"},{"text":"both inside and outside."},{"text":"As one might expect, building is a crucial time in the life of the yacht. As for all things, the amount of time, effort and"},{"text":"expense that goes into the building of yacht will determine the quality. This ‘in turn’ will translate both into the perceived"},{"text":"value and also to the degree of difficulty in selling the yacht in the future."},{"text":"In the yacht industry of today, yacht building or yacht production has developed into a very advanced and sophisticated"},{"text":"sector of the industry turning over many millions of pounds and producing many thousands of boats every year. However,"},{"text":"this does not mean that all sea going vessels built today are mass produced. Many individuals commission customised"},{"text":"boats whilst other build at home from scratch or purchase the basic hull and complete the craft as a home build. In reality"},{"text":"the market is as diverse as the mind of any individual."},{"text":"The sheer diversity of craft is one of the problems that a broker is faced with on a daily basis. There are many thousands"},{"text":"of different types of yacht built by a huge range of different builders over a long period of time. Some are well established"},{"text":"with good reputations, some are well established with bad reputations, some only ever build one or two craft.

It is his job to present the yacht in the best"},{"text":"possible manner in order to attract potential buyers to come and look at it. In doing this the yacht broker will generally"},{"text":"establish the title of the yacht i.e. whether or not the vendor is the legal Owner with the right to sell and he may also act"},{"text":"as the Owner’s agent in arranging for viewing and negotiating the sale."},{"text":"In the retail environment the yacht broker represents the builder or the builder’s sale organisation and will be selling a"},{"text":"boat that is new and the details of which are (or should be) well known to him."},{"text":"It is important to remember that the broker represents the interests of the vendor and not the buyer. Therefore, the broker"},{"text":"will be focused on ensuring that the price paid is as high as possible as this serves the interest of his client. Frequently,"},{"text":"although not exclusively, the broker will only be paid (the commission) on successful completion of a sale and this is"},{"text":"something that can lead to potential problems if it is not fully appreciated at an early stage."},{"text":"It should also be remembered that the broker is not a technical expert. Whilst many good brokers have extensive"},{"text":"knowledge of types of boats and their particular advantages and disadvantages as well as excellent knowledge of the"},{"text":"various physical aspects of a boat, it is not their job to be a technical expert. Sometimes this can lead to problems when a"},{"text":"broker finds out from a potential buyer (via a survey report) that the yacht he is offering for sale is not all that he believed"},{"text":"it to be or when defects are identified with a new boat of which he was unaware."},{"text":"As stated previously it is the broker’s role to represent the best interests of the vendor, whether this is the Owner of a"},{"text":"private yacht or a builder."},{"text":"As with other parts of the yacht brokerage industry, brokers can work as small companies (one-man bands) or form part"},{"text":"of a very large company with many employees."},{"text":"A yacht broker’s office in a large marina"},{"text":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage"},{"text":"9"},{"text":"The owner"},{"text":"In effect, it is the Owner who is the driving force behind the whole of the yacht brokerage industry. Without Owners there"},{"text":"would be no need for any of the other functions. Fortunately, however, there are many Owners with the desire to purchase"},{"text":"a yacht or small craft in order to get afloat."},{"text":"As with all things in the yacht industry there is a huge range of differences between Owners. Some are very wealthy and"},{"text":"buy luxurious yachts costing millions whilst some will go yachting on the smallest of budgets. In any event, one thing of"},{"text":"which the broker can be certain is that the Owner will generally be totally in love with his boat. Boat Ownership is about"},{"text":"passion and the prospective broker needs to understand that what might appear to be an ugly little tub to him is in fact"},{"text":"a dream boat to the person wishing to buy it."},{"text":"Owners need not be individuals. The legal title holder could be a company (body corporate) or a finance organisation that"},{"text":"has a contract with an individual (or company) such that the finance organisation remains the legal Owner until such time"},{"text":"as the loan for the craft has been repaid. In any event the broker needs an appreciation that the Owner may not necessarily"},{"text":"be the person or organisation that represents themselves to be so."},{"text":"The finance organisation"},{"text":"As yachts have become more and more luxurious and the cost to buy has increased, it has become far more common"},{"text":"for banks and financial institutions to lend money in order for an Owner to purchase the yacht. Loans normally take one"},{"text":"of two forms, secured and unsecured."},{"text":"An unsecured loan is in effect a contract between the finance organisation and the Owner and does not specifically"},{"text":"concern the craft. The finance organisation lends the money to the Owner who, in effect, promises (in a contract) to pay"},{"text":"it back. Therefore, in the case of an unsecured loan the lender is generally not interested in whether the craft is purchased"},{"text":"or not. These types of loan were common up until 2009 but with a significant slowing down of the world economy and"},{"text":"many banks having problems with bad debt (a small proportion of which would have come from the yacht industry) such"},{"text":"loans are not quite so readily available these days."},{"text":"A secured loan, however, means that the lender takes a charge (in effect takes legal title of the yacht) on the craft using"},{"text":"a contract. The lender agrees to loan the purchaser the money to buy and use the yacht subject to a range of terms and"},{"text":"conditions (normally including repayment terms, interest and sometimes insurance)."},{"text":"As a result the finance organisation will sometimes need an independent opinion as to the value of the yacht as the"},{"text":"physical value of the craft is the security against which the money is lent. Once again this moves into the territory of"},{"text":"the broker. Frequently a surveyor who carries out a condition survey will be asked to do a valuation and indeed this is"},{"text":"common practice. However, caution is needed here. It is the broker who sells the yacht and, therefore, by definition it is the"},{"text":"broker who knows, as a matter of fact, what any particular boat was worth at the time of sale (the sale price often being"},{"text":"an item of confidential information between vendor, purchaser and broker). This does not mean that a valuation done by"},{"text":"a surveyor is necessarily wrong, but it does mean that how the valuation is achieved and what it represents potentially"},{"text":"becomes very important."},{"text":"Yacht Brokerage"},{"text":"Module 1"},{"text":"10"},{"text":"The insurance company"},{"text":"Having purchased a yacht, on most occasions the Owner will wish to insure it. In doing so there are two basic types of"},{"text":"insurance that will be needed."},{"text":"The Lloyd’s of London Building"},{"text":"The first is Hull and Machinery insurance.

YACHTING SAFETY"},{"text":"As a general rule, there is little positive regulation of pleasure craft in the United Kingdom.

In commercial shipping terms this will"},{"text":"mean the country where the ship is registered. However, in the United Kingdom registration (i.e. registering the title to the"},{"text":"craft with a government) is not compulsory for leisure craft. Some yacht Owners choose to register their yachts fully under"},{"text":"the Flag State or in the UK some yacht Owners with a smaller vessel register their yachts on a special small craft register"},{"text":"but, as already stated, this is not necessarily compulsory for pleasure craft. Whilst this might initially appear surprising, it is"},{"text":"important to remember the tremendous diversity of craft. Registering a superyacht would clearly be an obvious thing to"},{"text":"do but should there be a requirement to register every windsurfer, canoe and sailing dinghy? The question of compulsory"},{"text":"registration for leisure craft is a debate that has been carried on for several decades and no immediate changes are"},{"text":"foreseen in the United Kingdom."},{"text":"Red Ensign on the stern of a yacht"},{"text":"In addition to providing registration, the Flag State also sets out the rules and regulations with which the government"},{"text":"of the country require craft to comply. Generally at an international level the International Maritime Organisation (IMO),"},{"text":"part of the United Nations, works to establish minimum acceptable standards for commercial craft on a worldwide basis."},{"text":"However, pleasure craft are normally expressly excluded from such requirements. Even though the IMO works to establish"},{"text":"such standards they do not have any powers to force any particular country to embrace the regulations. It is left to the"},{"text":"government of each individual country to introduce regulations through national legislation which the Flag State believes"},{"text":"satisfies the IMO requirements. Clearly, this can lead to different interpretations and differing standards. Furthermore,"},{"text":"having set the standard, the Flag State then needs to police the standard that it has set. To do this many Flag States have"},{"text":"marine surveyors who work as government employees to keep a check on the craft registered with that flag.

However, the exact requirements do vary from Flag State to Flag State. Of particular importance to note"},{"text":"here is that in many countries there is no legal requirement for a yacht to be built to any particular standard or to carry"},{"text":"even a minimum amount of safety equipment. In the United Kingdom for example there is no statutory requirement for"},{"text":"a yacht used only for private pleasure purposes to carry any sort of fire fighting or lifesaving equipment.

How much value"},{"text":"will you gain from trying to carry out an inspection of the outside of the craft during a rain or snow storm?"},{"text":"Location of the yacht plays a major part in the safety of the broker. Many yachts are located in modern marinas with"},{"text":"excellent facilities and good, safe access. However, initial inspections may be carried out in quite different locations. A"},{"text":"broker maybe asked to list a vessel that is kept in a modern boat yard where the yacht has been lifted ashore and chocked"},{"text":"in a purpose built cradle. Alternatively he could be asked to list a vessel that is kept on a semi-tidal, semi-soft mud mooring"},{"text":"on salt marshes miles from anywhere. At this point it is not the intention to explore whether carrying out an inspection"},{"text":"for listing the vessel in such conditions would actually be doing justice for the client (particularly in terms of the pictures!)"},{"text":"but it is meant to show the possible alternatives that may need to be considered."},{"text":"A yacht on dodgy supports"},{"text":"Carrying out an inspection of a yacht on a tidal mud flat might be the only realistic method of finding out the information"},{"text":"that is required for a listing. However, in such a circumstance the broker needs to be particularly aware of the specific risks of"},{"text":"working in such a location. Equally, working around a 100 tonne yacht suspended from a crane or straddle carrier when the"},{"text":"lifting strops are damaged or worn brings with it other types of risk. As a broker, do not be tempted into the false belief that the"},{"text":"boat yard or crane driver will always check that his equipment is satisfactory just because the boat yard has a good reputation."},{"text":"Always check for yourself that, wherever the yacht is, the surrounding environment is safe and appropriate in which to work."},{"text":"Sufficient lighting is vital to see properly what it is the broker is looking at but it is also vital for your safety. Large and old yachts"},{"text":"with no electrical power working present particular hazards to the broker as does working in a barn with no electricity and little"},{"text":"natural light. Make certain that there is adequate lighting whether this takes the form of two or more torches or the rigging of"},{"text":"temporary site lights run from a portable generator."},{"text":"Yacht Brokerage"},{"text":"Module 1"},{"text":"28"},{"text":"Ventilation is vitally important, especially if the broker is tempted to operate any of the equipment on board the yacht. Lack of"},{"text":"oxygen and a build up of carbon monoxide kills several people every year on board yachts, sometimes from leaking exhausts"},{"text":"and sometimes from faulty appliances and heaters. Also a build up of propane or butane gas in the bilges can lead to a serious"},{"text":"explosion with the introduction of a source of ignition. Therefore, always make certain that any boat that is being operated in"},{"text":"any way is properly and fully ventilated before committing yourself to the internal depths."},{"text":"Before boarding a craft make certain that it is safe to do so, particularly when the yacht is supported ashore. Sometimes the"},{"text":"securing of a yacht can be minimal and the potential for it to topple once the broker steps on board can be great. If in any"},{"text":"doubt, do not board but seek assistance from the yard to make certain the yacht is safe."},{"text":"Location and Communications"},{"text":"If working in remote and lonely locations make certain that someone is aware of exactly where you are and have a positive"},{"text":"reporting system for your safe return. From time to time individuals have accidents such as broken arms and legs from"},{"text":"slips and falls.

Normally such access is by means of a ladder. Make certain that ladders are fit for use, properly positioned and"},{"text":"secured at the top. If at all possible avoid clambering on adjacent structures or up the swimming platform ladder as both"},{"text":"have the potential to lead to accidents."},{"text":"If using temporary staging make certain that it is properly rigged and secured."},{"text":"Always keep in mind that in the event of an accident your insurance company may not pay out if you did not take all"},{"text":"reasonable precautions."},{"text":"Two examples of temporary staging"},{"text":"Sea Trial"},{"text":"Another area that can sometimes be overlooked from a general safety perspective is the sea trial. Depending upon the"},{"text":"vendor’s particular requirements it is not uncommon for the broker to organise the sea trial either directly (with the broker"},{"text":"acting as the skipper) or with the broker engaging a professional crew. In both cases the broker needs to keep in mind"},{"text":"essential health and safety."},{"text":"At its most basic the question “is the yacht in a safe condition to go to sea?” must be asked. Whilst an Owner can go afloat"},{"text":"in a totally unsafe condition, a broker, in his professional capacity cannot. In the event of an incident during a sea trial that"},{"text":"was reasonably foreseeable, the broker could find himself being held liable in negligence for taking (allowing) the yacht"},{"text":"to go to sea."},{"text":"Before allowing a sea trial the broker must, at the very least, believe the yacht to be in a safe condition, make certain it is"},{"text":"provided with adequate safety equipment, make certain it is properly manned by competent crew and ensure that the"},{"text":"trial only proceeds when the weather forecast is suitable. All crew should be briefed on basic safety procedures, including"},{"text":"the potential buyer and his attending surveyor."},{"text":"As stated at the start of this section, Health and Safety is in essence the application of common sense. However, an"},{"text":"enthusiasm to do the job or a desire to meet a deadline can introduce pressures (as can many other factors) that lead the"},{"text":"broker to overlook or ignore actions or precautions that he knows are sensible.

CUSTOMER RELATIONS AND COMMON COURTESY"},{"text":"A successful broker relies extensively on his ability to maintain good relationships with people, even in difficult"},{"text":"circumstances. It is important to remember that both attitude and appearance establish what are known as “first"},{"text":"impressions” long before an individual has a chance to demonstrate, through words and actions, that he is a trustworthy,"},{"text":"knowledgeable and capable individual."},{"text":"A broker needs to be diplomatic and yet assertive, communicative yet discreet, engaging yet respectful. As a broker,"},{"text":"you never know when or where you are likely to run into a customer (new or old). From the outset start off by treating"},{"text":"everybody with the same level of common courtesy, that way you are unlikely to be caught out. Remember that whilst"},{"text":"judgements about a person made on the basis of stereotypes can in many cases paint an accurate picture they are by no"},{"text":"means definitive and one careless word to the wrong person at the wrong time could cost you a very worthwhile client."},{"text":"Yacht Brokerage"},{"text":"Module 1"},{"text":"30"},{"text":"7. BROKERAGE COMPANIES AND ORGANISATIONS"},{"text":"There are three possible types of yacht brokerage company: the sole trader, the partnership and the limited company."},{"text":"The following is a description of the three types together with a brief description of the main advantages and"},{"text":"disadvantages."},{"text":"Sole Trader"},{"text":"A sole trader (or sole proprietor) is a business in which one person is the Owner. The business can, however, employ other"},{"text":"people. Operating this way removes most of the formalities of establishing a business. There is no requirement to register"},{"text":"as a sole trader for example or to present audited accounts."},{"text":"A sole trader is an unincorporated business; liability, therefore, lies with the proprietor. A sole trader has “unlimited liability”."},{"text":"This means that the personal savings and assets of the proprietor could be at risk if the business fails and the trader could"},{"text":"be made bankrupt. Equally, however, the sole trader takes all the profits."},{"text":"In the UK a sole trader is responsible to account for his earnings to both the Inland Revenue and Contributions Agency."},{"text":"The greatest single advantage to being a sole trader is the lack of requirements in respect of legal documentation and"},{"text":"procedures. Having made the decision to start in business, the moment you gain your first paying customer you are, in"},{"text":"fact, in business. The greatest single disadvantage is that you are entirely “on your own”. If anything goes wrong, everything"},{"text":"you have (in terms of personal property) is at stake."},{"text":"Partnerships"},{"text":"A partnership is a relationship between two or more people carrying on business together with a view to making a profit."},{"text":"Partnerships are neither incorporated nor registered. Unlike a company, therefore, a partnership has no separate legal"},{"text":"identity. For the purposes of legal transaction or litigation, only the members of the partnership can employ people,"},{"text":"own property, enter into contracts or be sued. As with sole traders each partner is regarded as liable on a personal basis."},{"text":"However, what is different for a partnership is that each partner is liable for all the debts of the partnership and assets can"},{"text":"be seized to pay off debts incurred by the partnership irrespective of which partner incurred the debt. In other words"},{"text":"a partnership has unlimited liability and partners are regarded as both jointly and severally liable for the debts of the"},{"text":"partnership."},{"text":"Management of the partnership is normally shared among the partners. It is common practice to have a Deed of"},{"text":"Partnership prepared which specifies the agreements between partners. If no such deed is prepared, in the event of a"},{"text":"dispute the Partnership Act of 1890 governs the arrangement between the partners."},{"text":"Profits (income less expenditure) are normally divided equally between the partners, unless the partnership deed specifies"},{"text":"otherwise."},{"text":"Each partner is individually responsible to account to the Inland Revenue and Contributions Agency for their earnings."},{"text":"Probably the greatest single advantage of a partnership is the combination of lack of formal regulation coupled with the"},{"text":"fact that you are not alone in making decisions and “running” the business. Having several people with particular strengths"},{"text":"working well together can produce a very potent combination. However, as for the sole trader, if things go wrong,"},{"text":"everything, in terms of wealth, is at stake."},{"text":"Limited Liability Companies"},{"text":"A company is a legal body in its own right, incorporated under the Companies Act 1985 (as amended in 1989). Most"},{"text":"yacht brokerage companies are normally private. That means they include the word “limited” in their name. (Public limited"},{"text":"companies use the term PLC). A private company must have at least one shareholder, at least one director and a company"},{"text":"secretary (who cannot also be the sole director). The main advantage of trading as a company is limited liability i.e. the"},{"text":"liability to pay debts incurred by the company are limited to the assets of the company and the share capital (personal"},{"text":"assets are not, therefore, normally at risk)."},{"text":"Trading as a limited company does, however, bring with it a number of duties and requirements that can add to the"},{"text":"administrative and financial burden. In order to form a company the following documents must be forwarded to the"},{"text":"Register of Companies together with a registration fee:"},{"text":"(i)"},{"text":"Memorandum of Association."},{"text":"(ii)"},{"text":"Articles of Association."},{"text":"(iii)"},{"text":"Declaration of compliance with the requirements of the Companies Act."},{"text":"(iv)"},{"text":"Statement of the first directors, secretary and registered office."},{"text":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage"},{"text":"31"},{"text":"Companies are also required to produce audited accounts and to file an annual report with the Register of Companies."},{"text":"Employees and directors pay income tax and National Insurance under the “Pay As You Earn” scheme and the company"},{"text":"pays corporation tax on any profits."},{"text":"The main advantage of a limited company is the mechanism of limited liability. In exchange for allowing a degree of"},{"text":"scrutiny of “how the business is run”, liability can be limited to the value of the company’s stock. The main disadvantage is"},{"text":"the requirement to satisfy a range of specific legal requirements in order to gain the privilege of limited liability."},{"text":"From a purely financial point of view it may generally be advantageous for new businesses to start as sole traders or as"},{"text":"partnerships and, if required, become incorporated at a later date."},{"text":"When first starting in business, before deciding on what sort of structure will be used, it is important to take appropriate"},{"text":"advice from both financial and legal experts. Frequently significant help is available from a number of different sources to"},{"text":"assist the start up business to make the first move."},{"text":"Management of a Brokerage Company"},{"text":"Organisational structure"},{"text":"Organisation of a brokerage company will depend entirely upon the size and complexity of the company. Some brokerage"},{"text":"companies consist of one person (with or without administrative assistance) with no management structure at all; whilst"},{"text":"others employ dozens of people and, therefore, require more formal management structures."},{"text":"In a one-man band, the boss has to undertake all the various roles required to make an organisation successful. In a larger"},{"text":"company, these roles are divided and particular individuals can be selected for their strength in a given area. The one-man"},{"text":"band will probably be extremely flexible with no particular rules, regulations or paperwork whereas the larger company"},{"text":"will need procedures and controls that will tend to make it somewhat less able to respond to every individual’s differences."},{"text":"No one type of organisation is necessarily better than any other, it is what suits the particular individual best."},{"text":"Office"},{"text":"For a broker, location is vital in terms of gaining work. On the south coast of the UK there are many yachts and hence the"},{"text":"potential for a lot of work. However, there are also numerous other brokers and, therefore, competition can be fierce. In"},{"text":"other parts of the country the exact opposite is the case."},{"text":"Generally, the brokerage office needs to be in a location close to the yachts that are being sold (although this is by no"},{"text":"means always the case particularly with brokerage companies operating over the internet). Such a location provides"},{"text":"visibility for the broker in terms of attracting potential vendors as well as providing a shop window for passing trade from"},{"text":"which to display those yachts that are for sale."},{"text":"Facilities"},{"text":"The main requirements for a brokerage office are good communication facilities and good data processing capability."},{"text":"Generally, people do not like talking to machines and, therefore, having someone to answer the telephone can be"},{"text":"important. However, with modern mobile communications and divert capabilities this is no longer the limitation it used"},{"text":"to be (subject to adequate mobile coverage in your area)."},{"text":"Yacht brokerage details are of vital importance as these are often the first things a potential buyer will come across."},{"text":"Personal computers together with word processing software, digital cameras and high quality printers make this relatively"},{"text":"easy."},{"text":"Remember that in the first instance all that your client sees of you is your brokerage details sheet (and possibly your"},{"text":"covering letter).

However, to be a good yacht broker is entirely another matter."},{"text":"A good broker needs to be an excellent communicator, he needs to be knowledgeable about people, knowledgeable"},{"text":"about the boats he is selling and an excellent organiser."},{"text":"Working as a yacht broker requires a certain kind of enthusiasm to last the course. Many people start as yacht brokers but"},{"text":"only the determined continue."},{"text":"Selection of personnel to work as brokers is extremely difficult and retention is even harder.
