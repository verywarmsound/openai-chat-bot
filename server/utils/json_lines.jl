{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"As with any industry grouping there are many different parts involved. The following overview of the different functions"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"also the space utilisation and ergonomics of both the internal and external spaces."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"Depending upon the particular designer, his role may be to develop the concept that is then passed to a Naval Architect"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"The actual building process will vary depending upon the type of material from which the yacht is to be built. However,"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"It should also be remembered that the broker is not a technical expert. Whilst many good brokers have extensive"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"or not. These types of loan were common up until 2009 but with a significant slowing down of the world economy and"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"A secured loan, however, means that the lender takes a charge (in effect takes legal title of the yacht) on the craft using"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"The second type of insurance is liability or third party insurance (often call third party liability insurance). This insurance"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"Sole Trader"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"A sole trader (or sole proprietor) is a business in which one person is the Owner. The business can, however, employ other"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"people. Operating this way removes most of the formalities of establishing a business. There is no requirement to register"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"as a sole trader for example or to present audited accounts."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"A sole trader is an unincorporated business; liability, therefore, lies with the proprietor. A sole trader has \u201cunlimited liability\u201d."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"This means that the personal savings and assets of the proprietor could be at risk if the business fails and the trader could"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"be made bankrupt. Equally, however, the sole trader takes all the profits."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"In the UK a sole trader is responsible to account for his earnings to both the Inland Revenue and Contributions Agency."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"The greatest single advantage to being a sole trader is the lack of requirements in respect of legal documentation and"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"procedures. Having made the decision to start in business, the moment you gain your first paying customer you are, in"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"fact, in business. The greatest single disadvantage is that you are entirely \u201con your own\u201d. If anything goes wrong, everything"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"you have (in terms of personal property) is at stake."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"Partnerships"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"A partnership is a relationship between two or more people carrying on business together with a view to making a profit."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"Partnerships are neither incorporated nor registered. Unlike a company, therefore, a partnership has no separate legal"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"identity. For the purposes of legal transaction or litigation, only the members of the partnership can employ people,"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"own property, enter into contracts or be sued. As with sole traders each partner is regarded as liable on a personal basis."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"However, what is different for a partnership is that each partner is liable for all the debts of the partnership and assets can"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"be seized to pay off debts incurred by the partnership irrespective of which partner incurred the debt. In other words"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"a partnership has unlimited liability and partners are regarded as both jointly and severally liable for the debts of the"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"partnership."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"Management of the partnership is normally shared among the partners. It is common practice to have a Deed of"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"Each partner is individually responsible to account to the Inland Revenue and Contributions Agency for their earnings."}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"Probably the greatest single advantage of a partnership is the combination of lack of formal regulation coupled with the"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"fact that you are not alone in making decisions and \u201crunning\u201d the business. Having several people with particular strengths"}}
{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"working well together can produce a very potent combination. However, as for the sole trader, if things go wrong,"}}

{"prompt":"An Introduction to Yacht Brokerage","examples":{"text":"Limited Liability Companies"}}
